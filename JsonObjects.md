# JSON Objects #
As the product of processing KML documents, `geoXML3.parser` creates a number of JSON objects which are exposed through its `docs` array.

## `doc` ##
The root object; one is created for each KML document processed. Properties:
|**Name**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-------|:-------|:--------------|
|`url`|`String`|The original source URL for the KML document|
|`markers`|`Array` of `google.maps.Marker`|Map markers generated by `parser.createMarker()`|
|`overlays`|`Array` of `ProjectedOverlay`|Map overlays generated by `parser.createOverlay()`|
|`bounds`|`google.maps.LatLngBounds`|Minimal lat/lng bounding box for geo features parsed from the KML|
|`styles`|`Object`|Associative array of JSON `style` objects, indexed by their KML style ID (prepended with `#`)|
|`placemarks`|`Array` of `placemark`|JSON representation of KML `<Placemark>` elements|
|`groundOverlays`|`Array` of `groundOverlay`|JSON representation of KML `<GroundOverlay>` elements|

The remaining JSON objects parallel their KML source elements, and (except where noted) contain the corresponding data.

## `style` ##
Created from KML `<Style>` elements. Structure:
```
{
  href: String,
  icon: google.maps.MarkerImage,   // Created from the image at href, assumed to be 32x32 pixels
  shadow: google.maps.MarkerImage  // Created as a "best guess" of the correct shadow image for icon
}
```
Note: icon and shadow are only created if parser.processStyles() is run, either automatically or manually (see parser methods in ParserReference). These can both be overridden before parser.createMarker() is called if necessary.

## `placemark` ##
Created from KML `<Placemark>` elements. Structure:
```
{
  name:        String,
  description: String,
  styleURL:    String
  style:       Object,  // When processStyles has been run, contains the associated style object
  point = {             // The KML Point element is parsed into these fields
    lat: Number, 
    lng: Number, 
    alt: Number
  }
}
```
Note: as of 4 June 2009, only marker `Placemark`s are processed.

## `groundOverlay` ##
Created from KML `<GroundOverlay>` elements. Structure:
```
{
  name:        String,
  description: String,
  icon: {
    href: String
  },
  latLonBox: {
    north: Number, 
    east:  Number, 
    south: Number, 
    west:  Number
  },
  opacity: Number    // 0-100, derived from the KML Color element
}
```
